### Branch Strategy

Are you falling behind? Don't worry, we have you covered. At each stage of the workshop we have provided checkpoints (branches) with the completed code. When you checkout a branch you will have everything you need for the next stage of the workshop.

What is a branch? A branch is an independent snapshot of the code.

```
git stash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

**Branches:**

* **step-2** - Routing
* **step-3** - Containers, Components & Styles.
* **step-4** - Redux
* **step-5** - Giphy API integration 
* **step-6** - Firebase API integration
* **step-7** - Completed workshop
