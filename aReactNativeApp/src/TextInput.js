// TextInput is a basic component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

// For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕🍕🍕".

// in this example, we store text in the state, because it changes over time.

// Text input is probably the simplest example of a component whose state naturally changes over time.
